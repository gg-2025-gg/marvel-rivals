            <h1>My favorite characters </h1>
            <p>One of my favorite character is spider-man because of his move set and movement but i am only starting to learn how to play. One of the reasons I like to play him is, the movement he has and all the combos he could do </p>
            <img src="images/spider_man.jpg" width="400px"  alt= "spider_man">

            <p>Another character i like is, loki, he is my first main and i like his move set he is a healer and his ultimate is coping other characters abilities/ultimates</p>
